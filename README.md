Problem Statement: Analyze and compare customer spending behavior on Black Friday between male and female customers, and evaluate the impact of other factors like marital status and age.

Target Metrics: Determine if spending differs between genders, calculate confidence intervals for average spending, and evaluate the impact of marital status and age on spending.

Approach: Imported and analyzed transactional data, checked for missing values and outliers. Performed univariate and bivariate analyses to understand spending patterns. Used confidence intervals to estimate average spending for male and female customers. Applied Central Limit Theorem to assess spending distributions and compared confidence intervals. Analyzed spending based on marital status and age groups.

Metrics Achieved: Identified significant differences in spending between genders, calculated confidence intervals, and assessed overlapping intervals. Found variations in spending patterns based on marital status and age.

Insights and Recommendations: Women spent 20% more per transaction than men on Black Friday, with no overlap in confidence intervals between genders. Recommended gender-specific marketing campaigns and personalized offers for different age groups to increase sales and customer engagement.
